## Bill of Materials (BOM)

* Linear Motion kit (or equivalent). You'll either need a linear-rod kit like <a href="https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B0797Q2C92">this one.</a> or equivalent parts. If you decide to source the parts yourself instead, here's what you really need from that kit:
	* 2x 8mm x 150mm smooth rails
	* 1x 8mm x 150mm lead screw
	* 2x LM 8UU bearings (the kit has these embedded inside linear slide blocks, but they pop out easily if you remove the retaining clip)
	* 1x 8mm lead-screw nut
	* 2x 42x24x10mm 8mm rail support block
	* 1x 48x12x27mm 8mm pillow block bearing
	* (You do not need the shaft couplers, plus there is an extra pillow block, 2 extra rail support blocks, and 2 extra bearings / linear slide blocks)
* One 6mm to 8mm shaft coupler, like <a href="https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B06X9W3TNS">this one.</a>
* An assortment of <a href="https://smile.amazon.com/Stainless-Assortment-Precise-Beautiful-Printed/dp/B0714FLXND">M3 screws & nuts.
* You will also need some square M3 nuts, as well as 2 M8 ones. Something like <a href="https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B06Y3NBT4Z">this</a> should cover it.
* 2x M8 x 30mm hex screws (<a href="https://smile.amazon.com/Machine-Phillips-Threaded-M8-1-25-Threads/dp/B00917MQC8">phillips head</a> or <a href="https://smile.amazon.com/M8-1-25-Socket-Screws-Stainless-Machine/dp/B07GCMGP8S">"button" style</a> [that accepts a hex driver]).
* 4x M6 x 20mm screws with nuts (for the rail support blocks)
* 2x M5 x 15mm screws with nuts (for the pillow block)
