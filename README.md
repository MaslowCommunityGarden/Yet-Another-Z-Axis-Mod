# Yet Another Z Axis Mod

A 3D-printed Z-Axis modification to the stock Z-Axis kit

I had gotten the z-axis kit with my Maslow originally, but I frequently found it off of spec when cutting. I tried all the simple fixes (bungee cord, gluing a bushing to the frame to keep alignment), and while they helped, I still had trouble with incomplete cuts way too often.

So I designed my own Z-axis kit that extends the stock solution, but doesn't rely on the Ridgid router's collar and it's not-intended-for-this-purpose mechanics.

The kit relies on the following parts from the original Maslow z-axis kit:
 
* Z-axis motor
* Z-axis motor mount

Additionally you will need the 3D printed parts that can be found in the garden and all the materials listed in the BOM.
