# Yet Another Z-Axis Mod

I had gotten the z-axis kit with my Maslow originally, but I frequently found it off of spec when cutting. I tried all the simple fixes (bungee cord, gluing a bushing to the frame to keep alignment), and while they helped, I still had trouble with incomplete cuts way too often.

So I designed my own Z-axis kit that extends the stock solution, but doesn't rely on the Ridgid router's collar and it's not-intended-for-this-purpose mechanics.

The kit relies on the Z-axis motor from the original Maslow z-axis kit. Other than that all parts are 3D printed or listed in the BOM.
 
Additionally you will need the 3D printed parts from the forum and all the materials listed in the BOM.

Shout out to Gary D (@gder) for doing a **lot** of work beta testing and for contributing a bunch of ideas to the design. Thanks to Gary the design is a lot better than it would have been.
